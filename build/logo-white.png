## Logo File Creation Instructions

Since we can't directly create a binary image file through this interface, please follow these steps to create a logo for your site:

1. Create a simple white "M" logo using one of these options:
   - Use an online logo maker tool like Canva, Figma, or Adobe Express
   - Download a ready-made pharmaceutical logo template
   - Create a placeholder logo using a service like https://placeholder.com/

2. Save the logo as "logo-white.png" in the public directory

3. Alternatively, you can use a placeholder logo URL directly in the Navbar component by replacing:
   ```jsx
   <img 
     src="/logo-white.png" 
     alt="Migliore Life Sciences" 
     className="h-8 w-auto"
     onError={(e) => {
       e.target.onerror = null;
       e.target.style.display = 'none';
     }}
   />
   ```

   With:
   ```jsx
   <div className="h-8 w-8 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-xl">
     M
   </div>
   ```

The logo should be white so it's visible against the blue primary color background in the navbar.
